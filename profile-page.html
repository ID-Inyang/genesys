        <h2>Hey there, My name is Idongesit Inyang</h2>
        <p>
          I am an entry level Web Developer and this is a story about my
          programming learning Journey. <br />Let's dive into it :)
        </p>
        <p>
          I started getting interested in learning how to code for the first
          time while in University when a friend introduced me to it. He had
          followed a tutorial video and made a video player on his laptop and it
          was really amazing. Then another friend of mine also decided to start
          learning it too at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had tried a couple time on my own to get into it but I had trouble
          staying consistent with learning especially when it got difficult, So
          I started and stop multiple time but I never really lost interest in
          it. I always told myself that one day I'll learn how to code and build
          something incredible. Being inspired by other successful programmers
          stories like Mark Zuckerburg, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Elon Musk
          also played a huge role in keeping me motivated to still want to learn
          how to code even when I would stop for months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I continued to try and apply myself whenever I could and I enrolled in
          programs that were free to try and finish it and get a certified after
          I learned that being certified could also help to get a job. One day
          while scrolling through Instagram I came across the Genesys Upskill
          Program and I saw what the program offers so I decided to apply to it
          so that I could learn and build projects and also be certified and
          while in the program we were told about a 100 days of coding where we
          could code everyday to be consistent and show our progress to
          prospective employers so I decided to take part in it and it has
          really been interesting so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, that's about it concerning Journey for now. I'd love to hear about
          yours too.
